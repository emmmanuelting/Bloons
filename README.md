## Bloon Progression
What makes Bloons a special tower-defense game are the enemies that tread along the track. Aside from this being a kids-genre tower defense game, which is already unique itself, the target-enemies are multi-layered rather than having a set HP. Multi-layered refers to different layers in a Bloon.

For example, a Red Bloon is the weakest, only requiring 1 popping power to eliminate it. A Blue Bloon would be the next strongest requiring 2 popping power to pop all of its layers. **When Blue is popped once, it will become Red.** It is the transformation of these targets that makes Bloons truly unique.

Additionally, there can be special attributes to each Bloon, making stronger them stronger, as well as higher-power Bloons naturally having special attributes.

      The order of layers is as follows:
      Ceramic --> Rainbow --> Zebra --> White/Black --> Pink --> Yellow --> Green --> Blue --> Red
